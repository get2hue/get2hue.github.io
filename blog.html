						</p>
						<p class="post-intro">16th December 2011. I know the date very well because<br><br>
							1)	It was one of those crazy assignment due dates in university and best of all<br>
							2)	It was the day I MET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!<br>
							<p>I was supposed to meet up with another colleague so we all head to the restaurant for dinner to celebrate a friend’s birthday. After staying up to finish my assignment the night before I was completely exhausted by the time it came to getting ready. Once I was done I called my friends to ask where to meet up but no one answered. I had just given up, taken my heels off and was about to head home when the birthday girl called back. I weighed my options and thought, either go hang out with friends or have a lonely date on a Friday night with my computer. You can pretty much guess which one I chose.</p>
							<p>At the restaurant we met a few other people there. I popped to the ladies briefly only to come back and find a few more gentlemen at the table and sat directly opposite me was HIM! A few HI’s were said here and there and we started chatting. We all had a great time (well whenever there is food that equals great time to me LOL); we ate, laughed and chatted into the night. The rest of the group decided to take the party to a club. I was too tired so I decided to skip the clubbing.
							As I said my goodbyes and all, Ugo approached me and asked for my number. I was reluctant at first and asked him to get it from my friend (girl code for dismissing a guy) knowing she will not give him. As if he knew, Ugo did not fall for it. He was persistent and I finally gave in. That night a text turned into a call, calling got upgraded to skyping and then the first date!</p>
						</p>
                       <h6>First Date</h6>
						<p>
						    Since it was during the Christmas holidays, Ugo went to see his family outside London so we were mostly calling and skyping throughout the holiday. Just 2 weeks after we met, he finally asked me out. We went out for a movie and spent the rest of the evening chatting. We went to our separate homes and ended up straight on Skype. That was the night he officially asked me to be his girlfriend. Although I liked him a lot I didn’t say yes straight away. C’mon I needed to make him sweat it out a little LOL. After a few more dates I finally agreed to be his girlfriend.
						 </p>

						 <h6>The Proposal</h6>
						 <p> 
						    2 years later we went for a friend’s wedding. All throughout that day he wasn’t himself. I asked many times if he was ok but he kept saying he was. I thought to give him space and when he was ready he will tell me what was bugging him. We went to the mall that day but I can’t remember what for. Out of the blue he said he wanted to go home to ease himself. Just like you are thinking I found it a bit strange seeing there were many restrooms around the mall. I mentioned it to him but he gave me a flimsy excuse. I got angry with his weird behaviour or whatever he was hiding. I told him to go and that I wanted to continue shopping. After a while he called me asking if I was still in the mall. He told me his friend which I had not met yet was in a nearby hotel and wanted to meet me. Immediately like a woman I thought he probably used that as an excuse to go see his friend now he wants me to come along as well.
					     </p>
					     <p>
					     ......I met him halfway and followed him to the hotel. He was walking ahead of me and went into the room first. As I pushed the door open I noticed it was quiet dark and in my head I was wondering what a creepy friend would be expecting people and not bother to put the light on. I pushed the door all the way open that was when I saw Ugo on his knees with the ring and there were flowers on the bed with candle light lit all over the room. With the flowers he had written “Ruby please grow old with me”. I was majorly surprised. I was expecting anything. At that point I did not know if to hug him or hit him.I said YES to him and well you know what comes next once a woman says YES!

						<p class="post-intro">It was on the 16th of December 2012, a very cold evening. I was invited for a birthday party but all I wanted to do was to stay at home and keep warm but I reluctantly went for the party. It was a dinner party in a nice restaurant and as I walked in I saw some people seated and chatting. I was directed to sit facing an empty seat, and few minutes afterwards the lady in blue walked towards our table and sat facing me, we had a good chat and I made sure I took her number before leaving. We became friends and spent quality time on the phone we would talk for hours on the phone and on skype everyday for abt 2weeks and I asked her on a date i felt like I had known her for many years and I had that connection with her that is inexplicable. It was magical then I asked her to be my girl and she said NO. I did not give up but threw my best shots for a couple of days and she eventually said yes. The rest as they say is history..</p>
